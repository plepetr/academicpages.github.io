A PhD student at Institute of Economic Studies at Charles University and a junior researcher at CERGE-EI, a joint workplace of Charles University and the Economics Institute of the Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic. 

My research revolves around the transmission of knowledge and technology in the economy. I look into the global value chain integration and inspect the different ways it affects productivity (first dissertation paper). Using data on R&D expenditure in the Czech Republic, I estimate the direct R&D returns and also the spillovers to other industries (second dissertation paper). The third paper is planned to bridge the previous two and see how R&D efforts steer the impacts of value chain integration in the right direction.
